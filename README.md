## Update

Don't run the script below (but actually) because the funny text we are trying to get has been hidden.

As of 2022-07-20, the following is still active: `$2a$10$bL4bIL5pUWqfcO7KQtnMReakwtfHbNKh6v1uTpKlzhwoueEJQnPnm`

You should not run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/insertish/TotallyNormalRepository NothingGoingOnHere
cd NothingGoingOnHere
pwsh InnocentLookingScript.ps1
```

Do not pay any attention to the file named [go_away.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insertish/TotallyNormalRepository/master/go_away.png) which does not contain any instructions.

> Note: you need to have 7-Zip installed and accessible as `7z`.
